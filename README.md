🦠 COVID-19 Detection: Comparative Accuracy of Chest X-Ray vs. CT Scan

📌 Overview

This project evaluates the comparative accuracy of Chest X-Rays and CT Scans in detecting COVID-19. By analyzing patient data and imaging results, we aim to determine which imaging modality provides superior diagnostic performance. Based on our analysis, CT Scans demonstrate higher accuracy compared to Chest X-Rays in detecting COVID-19.

🚀 What’s Inside?
✅ Comparison of Chest X-rays & CT scans for COVID-19 detection
✅ Flask-powered web application for seamless interaction
✅ Machine Learning models for intelligent analysis 🤖
✅ Easy-to-setup virtual environment for a smooth workflow


🚀 Technologies Used

Python 🐍
Flask 🌍 (Backend Framework)
Machine Learning 🤖
Medical Imaging Analysis 🏥
Data Science Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, etc.)

 Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:
1)Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment helps manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

2) Install Required Dependencies
 pip install Flask numpy pandas scikit-learn opencv-python pillow  

3) Running the Flask App
  python app.py  
The application will be available at:
🔗 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

 Results
After testing and comparing results, CT scans achieved higher diagnostic accuracy than Chest X-rays, making them more effective for COVID-19 detection.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Expand dataset for more robust results
🔹 Implement deep learning models for improved accuracy
🔹 Develop a full-stack web app for real-time analysis
